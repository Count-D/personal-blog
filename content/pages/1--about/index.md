I am a Full-stack Web Developer from Zrenjanin, Serbia. Worked on more then 20 various projects on Frontend as well as a few on a Backend. My main building tool is Javascript, Mostly using React js on the Frontend and Express js on the Backend. Also have experience with NoSql Databases like MongoDB.

I am also Environmental Engineer by my University Degree an I love spending time in Nature and have been participating in couple of NGO projects on Nature Preserving in my recent years.

Recently I started this Blog to share my knowledge and Ideas about newest technologies and how can it change the World. It won't be purely technical blog. I will try to simplify all the complex subjects to a level that everyone can understand and see it more clearly.

Thank you for your attention. Hope you will get some value.
